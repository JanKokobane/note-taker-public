# 📒 Notes Journal – React Native Notes Application

## Overview
Notes Journal is a secure note‑taking application built with React Native. It allows users to create, manage, and organize notes into categories such as **Work**, **Study**, and **Personal**. The app implements full CRUD functionality and uses **AsyncStorage** as a lightweight local database.

This project was developed as part of the React Native curriculum (Lesson 3), focusing on navigation, routing, and authentication.
